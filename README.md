# Weather_Forecast_Application

This is a weather application that tells you the current days weather as well as the next four following days. 

To use this, you simply need to type in the city name of the location and press search.
The application will then fetch the API and use the needed data onto the page. 

This was developed using Javascript, HTML, and by me with help from TA's.
